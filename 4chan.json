It&#039;s so confusing because they put in segments where you play as Riku and Aqua but only for 3 fights in the entire game.<br>They refused to let anybody else be competent so that they could give Sora screentime to become the hero of the game but they forgot to make him competent either.<br><br>The combat was mid too.

Datas all have hyper armor nonsense, it&#039;s cranked up to 11 with Yozora, and it&#039;s pointless trial and error to find the &quot;secret set openings&quot; instead of just fucking attacking when you get close to them. Counters are just replaced with teleport spam that resets everything to neutral. Sora&#039;s moveset is still garbage where Links are nerfed to shit (they are garbage mechanic anyway) and melee is trash where aerial/grounded states are the same thing (including defense) while doing pathetic damage.

AI variation is the same recycled shit that&#039;s no longer random. Spacing is entirely irrelevant thanks to Airstep. And I can keep going too.<br><br>Limit Cut was garbage, KH3 is and will always be a joke of a game. It has nothing on the classic of KH1 or the masterpiece that was 2.

            "<a href=\"#p631648631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;631648631</a><br>Okay, so let me break it down for you. Like seriously.<br><br>If your character is melee you really want stuff that gives you: +Hit (as in chance to hit), +Crit, and +Attacks. Look for that stuff. Weapon specialization, two weapon fighting, teamwork feats like outflank and seize the moment, improved critical feats. I know that sounds like a word salad but seriously just remember that: HIT. CRIT. ATTACKS. <br><br>Damage and Defenses are good too, by the way, and if there are not good feats available to you in terms of offense, getting a nice defensive feat is great too, and some of the damage feats like power attack are good when you can overcome their negatives. As long as you remember HIT, CRIT ATTACKS.<br><br>For spell casters you wanna look at what they&#039;re already good at and just pick everything that powers up what they&#039;re good at. For example, Nenio is a wizard you get. She specializes in illusion magic. If you search &#039;Illusion&#039; you will find feats like specializations and such to power them up. Also spell penetration. You can also take meta magic feats. The two best ones are the Selective (makes it only hit bad guys) and Heighten (lets you basically make a spell higher level so it it is stronger). Get those and just pick shit related to what they do. It looks overwhelming, but just think about what actually makes your spells stronger. Ignore all the weird dumb bullshit.",

In game when you first aprouch hitler he appears to be a stoic jew hater but after you get to know him you understand he is actually a good guy that likes animals (not in a sexual way) and truly cares about the future of his nation. the message is amplified by the fact that hitler was real and is still considered a controversial figure. it appers to me that you have never played sex with hitler as if you had you would&#039;ve understood the message of not judging books by their covers, so you would&#039;nt have used the game as an insult, you would have teeated it with the marurity it deserves as over 5 people died in the holocaust. Some might say that sex with hitler is &quot;distasteful&quot; or &quot;disrespectful&quot; but anyone who has played the game will tell you it is quite the opposite, The story of hitler is mearly a vessel to teach the audience something. for example, in your third sexual encounter with adolf chan you see him spread his asshole open like goatsey and beg you to &quot;pump me full of it&quot; this level of sexual derangement is meant to make hitler look bad as pumping someone full of lead is a common expresion for saying they got shot, witch hitler did do to himself on october 26th 1947. there are a lot more subtle allusions to adolf chan killing himself later on in the game like when in chapter 5 he blankly states &quot;I am going to kill myself&quot; this is meant to portray the Nazi german military as corrupt as the killing is symbolizing the crumbling of thw party after hitlers death. I could go on about sex with hitler for days but in conclusion Don&#039;t Fuck With Sex With Hitler",

Like in Dark Souls you can feel like you&#039;re seeing a smaller part of a much larger whole, in Elden Ring the emptiness of the larger world kind of takes me out of it. Makes it feel more like just a game with a bunch of padded content to fill things out. But, I imagine some people do get some benefit from it.

Rockstar needs to seriously dial back on the side characters and really focus on AI npcs that flesh out the worlds, run on schedules, etc. You should be given the OPTION of running in a gang, using a sort of Shadow of Mordor Nemesis system style of generation, where you can come across other outlaws and form rivalries with them or recruit them into your gang, and you can have falling out with them and run into them and their new rival gang out in the world, etc. The game could constantly be keeping itself fresh through the generation of these personalities; you killed the sheriff in town? his replacement is meaner and teams up with one of your former gangmember who knows where your hideout is, they come into your hideout randomly and you kill the gangmember and spare the sheriff, bribing him to turn the other cheek in exchange for his life, giving you freer reign in the territory; you know, more emergent shit like that.

Saying you offer PR and community management but just out sourcing it to an agency that already does that means you are just a middle man taking a cut of the profits for yourself while offering nothing they dev couldn&#039;t have gotten on their own. Same with QA, porting and localization. As someone else already asked, does he even have any employees? Because otherwise it&#039;s just a youtuber using his clout to be an unneeded middleman while taking part of the profits and diluting the dev&#039;s personal brand. Concerned Ape still has to deal with people thinking Chucklefish made Stardew Valley or that he&#039;s working on future Chucklefish games when they just published it and then later sold the publishing rights back to him. He has not so subtly implied he thinks it was a mistake and has encouraged other devs not to use publishers for this reason, particularly if they plan to make more games. I think a guy whose made one of the most successful modern indie games knows more about it than a Youtuber with a funny voice that unironically thinks he deserves to not be banned from games for intentionally ruining matches because he&#039;s such a special boy.<br><br>or tl;dr Dunkey is a manchild and only a fool would ever get involved with him",

Even what it means to analysis has been obfuscated: because what I see is people just summarized the game, and maybe examine how the mechanics work with each other. Which is fine, but you&#039;re either spoiling the game for secondaries, or you&#039;re just retelling it. AVGN and Spoony talked about games that you wouldn&#039;t play cause they were shit, Ross finds random games that are a pain to play and shows you the highlights, etc etc. These videos have a point, which is &quot;let me tell you about a game you wouldn&#039;t want to play&quot;.<br>Meanwhile, the guy who did the Persona 4 video, is useless. Because either you didn&#039;t play the game, in which case why are you watching a video about it? Or you DID, and you&#039;re just getting a rehashed experience. Hell even ZP does a decent job of telling you about the game&#039;s strengths and weaknesses for a review<br><br>The best analysis is if they take a topic/mechanics and see how it evolves, whether in the game or game series.

Isaac and Roguelikes in general basically do the concept pretty well. Give your skills modifiers that uniquely change their properties that can allow for thousands of potential synergies and permutations. It makes games very re-playable. <br>The needing links and socket colors etc is a balance and online cost thing and are fucking dumb (they&#039;re removing that in 2 so it seems like they realize this themselves). I also agree with the over leveling thing, that&#039;s rare in the game, it&#039;s mainly for things like mana management, or in rare instances, for attack speed timing in rarer instances working with more modern CoC builds (Cospri&#039;s etc). Some builds WANT high cost mana spells, some don&#039;t and depend on very small mana costs and mana leech to push as much power out of the build as possible, but difficulty increases over the time without substantial player buffs (big part of what everyone in the thread is complaining about, their refusal to buff player power/fun) have made that less of a minmax thing and more of a requirement. But I agree it&#039;s a dumb system and you should just be able to freely go up and down from levels of a gem once you&#039;ve leveled too it and its just another stupid currency sink because they&#039;re desperate for playtime and think that the best way for long player retention is to tax player time instead of making it more enjoyable/easy to level up, and too milk whales they need to limit the risk of players maxing a build, getting bored and leaving till next league not buying points.

I think no matter what it will disappoint some people but I don&#039;t think they would even attempt to make a new Tenkaichi if they didn&#039;t plan on going all out.

He&#039;s initially sent out on a mission to assassinate his father, but it turns out that there&#039;s a complex plan to defeat this group of rapist wizards (and some aliens) called the Unholy Consult, who want to cull the human population so they can escape damnation. When the human population is below a hundred thousand, there&#039;s not enough consciousness to sustain hell: Everyone who dies just goes to oblivion instead. <br>Kellhus, over the course of twenty years, raises an enormous army to take the fight to the Unholy Consult. He makes it all the way there, to find out that the Unholy Consult has subsumed the Dunyain. Being hyper-rationalists, the Dunyain see that they have no reason NOT to side with the Consult (as they&#039;re all damned to Hell anyway.)<br>Kellhus, expecting this confrontation, has ensured he&#039;s possessed by a demon so he can nuke them. Unfortunately, they outplay him: Kellhus&#039; crazy son (who is like, twelve) distracts him at a crucial moment and Kellhus is instantly turned to salt, killing him. <br>Kellhus&#039; son is shoved into a sacrophagus and possessed by the No-God, an AI that is both a powerful weapon and has the metaphysical ability to ensure that no living children are born.<br>Outside, Kellhus&#039; army starts celebrating just in time to take the No-God&#039;s manifestation (a black whirlwind) right in the fucking face.<br>Then millions of Orcs come pouring out of Mordor, to rape and kill everyone. Every surviving member of the cast flees screaming into the night, pursued by the Crossed. <br>And that&#039;s where we leave off.",

And what they find out- is if you do some really really reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly nasty shit. Like just rape murder genocide cum fuck shit eat. Just the vilest things imaginable. You can BLOT out the eye of the gods and prevent heaven OR hell from seeing your soul. But it takes special souls and industrial scale rape murder so they travel across the galaxy or universe from the nail in the sky (some fuckin portal or some shit he never clarifies this) and eventually find earwa where they can create an inverted god that will not just blot out a single space in time but PERMANENTLY starve gods and demons of their souls, freeing them from salvation or damnation. <s>Cept they are all dead fucking retards. all that remains now are their rape goblins and people who picked up their work and went &#039;ohhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuccckkk&#039;</s>",

Malazan is praised for having a complicated plot unfolding over a lot of pages, with things coming together books later. But every second 1000-chapters cultivation novel has a comparably complicated plot.

The other side can attempt to counter by shooting chorae affixed to arrows or bolts into the sorcerers or sending their own sorcerers and if they don\u2019t their conventional troops will get slaughtered.",

There are tons of knockoffs, replicas, and even stupidly expensive couture versions so its sort of up to you how much you want to spend. For what its worth, when I was younger (and even had Leon hair naturally; in the late 90s and early 2000s it was one of the &quot;handsome guy&quot; styles you pulled off if you were able and if you were reasonably attractive it looked good) I thought about getting one myself. One thing to keep in mind is that cosplay and replica locales are sometimes not designed with function in mind, unless they&#039;re REALLY high end. Material quality matters and a bunch of chinky asia imports will NOT look the same on you as they do in the catalogue if they&#039;re made wwith shit material. Consider looking into both classic and modern versions of the jacket but keep in mind stuff like being able to flip it up or down, pocket style and location and other elements<br><br>Anyway good luck, OP. Since this is now a subtle vidya clothing thread, pic related is fucking expensive but at least its at least possibly worth it. Those who dont know, Kojima Productions partnered with high end German activewear lineup ACRONYM and made a nearly perfect replica of Sam&#039;s Death Stranding coat. Its close to $2000 USD, but admittedly the version without Bridges icons or the (removable) pocket set to BB yellow is like $1700+ so its kinda sorta reasonable in that regard.",

Heroism isn&#039;t about the self, it&#039;s not about going on adventures or discovering your inner desires, but fulfilling a sworn duty and actually making a difference. Barely any video game right now has you complete quests with noticeable positive impacts, or become a part of something great. I guess Earth Defense Force kind of accomplishes this goal, at least until the plot becomes wacko B-movie shit. The same can be said for Armored Core, it&#039;s got the idea of anonymous heroism down but flubs it with the mech autism. <br><br>For that sort of thing you really have just revivalist crpg&#039;s and a few indie games, there&#039;s basically nothing out there being made where escapism makes you into a hero. Even DOOM Eternal fucks it up by never showing the world become any better thanks to you killing demons.",

BP Boost is also good, especially paired with A Step Ahead to have 3 BP in the first non Step Ahead round. Full Power is good for a lot of characters. Ochette or Hikari with FP, BP Boost, and A Step Ahead can pretty much wipe out random encounters in an instant. Agnea is good with those paired with Merchant for Arrow of Fortune spam to get extra JP. Getting Vigorous Vigor is also cheap as hell and can sustain you while you travel before you get to those capstone abilities. <br><br>For Ochette I aimed for multi hitting attacks and upgraded them to their All versions when I came across them. If you go get a Revenant early it can carry you through pretty much any random encounter with the Step Ahead and BP Boost combo. Chubby Caits throw out a slew of buffs and Octo Kings hit enemies with debuffs so they&#039;re pretty solid, especially with her 2nd EX skills. Battle Tested Shark is fucking bonkers, you can get it in the ocean during the day after you fight it as a boss. You can get Scourge of the Seas the same way just during the night. Shark hits all enemies with a dagger hit and restores your party&#039;s HP, SP, and gives 1 BP. Scourge slams the fuck out of one enemy and does a guaranteed 6 shield break.

For everyone&#039;s technique to be effective on one another and instantly or near-instantly kill each other is a vastly better aesthetic overall than for characters to find themselves indefinitely locked in combat where none of their moves are effective on each other, like in those fast &quot;scuffle&quot; sequences in DBZ for instance.",

Why are they in such a rush to cut open the rare immune girl? There is no guarantee that a parasitic organism can survive outside of its host, or that the cause of immunity doesn&#039;t come from the girl herself rather than her strain of fungus. She is infinitely more valuable alive where you could take samples from her for a long period of time, rather than gamble on the risk that killing her either produces the cure or destroys it. If they didn&#039;t have the resources to take samples without killing her, then they shouldn&#039;t fucking rush it right now.<br><br>It might be because I&#039;m a biomed major and the ending is written by and aimed at someone with zero background in science so they just don&#039;t think about how illogical and stupid the situation is.",

People who pirate:<br>Poorfags or people from developing countries (99% of pirates fall into this category)<br>People who are not poor but are very stingy/thrifty and are psychologically incapable of spending money when there is a free alternative (this is the remaining 1%)<br><br>Most people don&#039;t pirate and never will because it takes some small amount of tech knowledge and &#039;risk taking&#039; which acts as a barrier to entry. And of the remaining people who DO pirate, it is exceptionally rare that anyone would have bought the game anyway had they been unable to pirate. The idea that piracy is a big problem then is just stupid. It comes from the greed of big companies, and from people who feel it&#039;s unfair. But they&#039;re retarded.",

That\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s no way to play them on PS4/PS5, as they\u2019ve never been added to the emulator or ported. \\n\\nReally do hope the new interest from AC6 influences them to add all the previous games to current-gen.",

            "I never played them, I only knew it existed because of a review of Dark Souls 1. Seeing the new trailer got me pretty hype because I looked back on some of the older Armored Core games and they look so damn fun. I always liked mechs but not enough to watch anime or play games about them, especially because I feel they don\u2019t do them right. But in Armored Core, they look so fun and so mobile.",

I suck at parrying in Souls games.\\n\\nBut I do at least know what I'm getting from Armored Core, having played several of the games ages ago. My only concern is that they take the wrong lessons learned from Souls and try to apply it to Armored Core, kind of like how DS3 used Bloodborne pacing without it quite fitting into Souls (getting stunlocked to death by daggers while wearing heavy armor was just... infuriating)",

Shoulder buttons strafed left/right and looked up/down. Even after dual analog was implemented with the option for what is now basic shooter controls, I still preferred the original, made it easier to strafe boost hop while looking up/down accurately. \\n\\nBack in the day armored core was most definitely about piloting skill if you wanted to be good, like one of the only games I\u2019ve played where using super light no defense builds worked really well if you could pilot well cause you just didn\u2019t get hit that much. Early armored core combat at a high level was super fast and mobile, if you stopped moving even for a second you\u2019d probably eat something big. \\n\\nWasn\u2019t super accessible to the masses though, later games kinda toned down the things that made it good to make it more accessible IMO",

            "When I found out that the AC series was made by the Dark Souls people, I looked back on it, and realized that I could already see it. Brutal difficulty (Oh this mission will be a cakewalk, Raven. Definitely no Invading ACs!), sparse story-telling (more about e-mails than item descriptions, but still), strong character customization, heavy skill focus in spite of the customization options, often times opaque and difficult to understand mechanics...\\n\\nAll I really hope is that they take those awesome games, and bring in all the lessons they learned from making the Souls series without compromising their identity. I'm particularly worried we'll get something like DS3 having upped pacing from Bloodborne, without really being designed for it in the same way that BB was. I could easily see them trying to apply lessons from Souls that just don't apply to Armored Core.\\n\\nBut honestly, even the worst FromSoft games are really good. And unlike Sekiro, I know what I'm getting into when I buy it.",

I'm pretty sure you started with most of the mech parts unlocked, and you could pilot it yourself, but the game would recommend allowing the AI to do it after every match. I might be misremembering though, because I only played it for a couple weeks over 10 years ago.",

Anyone who was actually good at the older games likes how Armored Core V and VD evolved the old school formula. 4 and For Answer are great games and all, but horribly balanced.\\n\\nVD in particular is near perfect 4v4 tactical fast paced explosive gameplay.

            "It differentiated itself from the other games in a not good way. They took too many chances to be slightly different and it made the end product the weakest souls game by far. \\n\\nI really liked it, it's the only souls game I got to NG7 on. There was some truly baffling things though, like adaptability stat giving you more iframes (I truly think DS2 at 0 adp vs 38 are two different games, with it at 0 being unplayable). \\n\\nThrow in all the weird world stuff (elevator ride to the iron keep is still top 10 funniest moments in gaming), clearly rushed development (watch the opening cutscenes), overall jank of combat, LIFEGEMS, excessive bonfires (which at this point DS1 might just be lightning in a bottle for that sort of challenge), weapon classes all feeling the same (great sword butter knife, anyone?), Smelter Demon boss battle (but this time it's BLUE!). \\n\\nI say it deserves the hate, but only because we know how much better it could have been. I'd argue the highest high in DS2 is the sir alonne fight, maybe fume knight, MAYBE looking glass knight (goddamn that fight is slept on), it doesn't hold a candle to the Gwyns, the abyss watchers, the slave knight Gaels. Even atmospheric-wise, you get an \"oh shiiiiiiit\" moment entering anor londo in ds1, irithyll in ds3, but it just never comes for me in DS2. Shrine of Amana and majula look cool, but it just doesn't hit the right notes.",
            "I really feel the flaws get overplayed, while the upsides get downplayed. Nobody criticizing it ever mentions Bonfire Ascetics and different NG+ cycles even as a \"It's not all bad\" moment, even though I've never heard a single person not like them.\\n\\nThe games multiple routes (5 off of Majula) feel more open and like genuine options unlike DS1, which was technically open, but with a very intended path to follow, whereas in DS2, Forest of Fallen Giants is meant to be the starting point, but after that, while there is something of an encouraged route order, it's a heck of a lot easier to go outside of it than it is to go to New Londo or the Catacombs early. And even if you prefer DS1 to DS2, then DS2 is still leagues ahead of linear DS3 and Bloodborne.\\n\\nAdaptability wasn't the best choice, but it's not nearly as big of a deal as people make it out to be. What's more, DS2 lacks Resistance and Luck. I'd rather have another required stat akin to Health, than to have a trap stat that is either useless, or only for very niche builds. Also, Agility went up with Attunement, so Mages could get the stat for free.\\n\\nDark Souls 2 also decoupled Stamina and Equipment Weight, which has been kept throughout the series. Dark Souls 3 provided a retcon explanation for Iron Keep, thanks to the Dreg Heap showing the world quite literally bent out of shape. Heck, the very concept of Dark Souls 3, that there have been countless Ages of Fire, was introduced by this game.\\n\\nThere's a lot of good in Dark Souls 2, and so much of it seems to be glossed over. And honestly, I never found it's flaws to be all that bothersome. Lifegems are cheesy, but you can just... not use them. The game is only built around them existing in the early game, but that's when they're expensive relative to what it costs to level up, and the ones you find lying around are enough to get started with. Once you clear the FoFG, then you're done.\\n\\nThat being said, I will never forgive the Shrine of Winter. I can't believe Iron Keep gets all this shit, while nobody ever mentions the Shrine of Winter. The Shrine of Winter blocks your progress until you collect the four lord souls (or 2m total souls, an alternative that is made practical thanks to Bonfire Ascetics, another cool feature), but when you get past it, you find yourself on the other side of a small pile of rubble. That you walked past before. That a literal five year old child could have climbed over. Yes, Iron Keep makes no sense, but at least we know the world is a warped mess when the First Flame is dying out, so it sorta kinda has an explanation. But the Shrine of Winter bothers me so much more. And that's not even taking into account that you could theoretically walk through the hills and woods around it. But the Rubble of Winter bothers me sooooo much  more.",

But, again, before you get tore up about it, that's my opinion. My personal feelings. And VD is better than V, but I still prefer the older games. The games weren't inherently harder, but the UI, menu layouts, mech designs, and story all felt different enough to be off-putting for me.

The RTS playerbase is so small compared to other genres and there isn\u2019t a good way to capitalize on micro-transactions from RTS either so the potential amount of money that a good RTS can make is way lower than something like a Call of Duty that can be farted out every year to print money.

            "I completely disagree that it's because of the profit margins. RTS fans or historical games fans are of the most loyal fans out there. It's more because:\\n\\na) these games are extremely hard to balance out, if you've a programming background and some mathematical understanding you'd know that it's a nightmare to balance out the gameplay i.e. interplay of the units, upgrades, civs, terrain etc., and gets even more complicated as you progress from the ages i.e. ancient to gunpowder to modern that's why arguably the only game to do it well was Rise of Nations  \\n\\n\\nb) the execs run things rather than the passionate devs: the above problem requires a very different type of developer, someone with mathematical skills rather than programming skills and those guys are expensive and rare because they get hired in other quant fields that pay well, in any case I don't think we need to go into the exploitative nature of the gaming industry and the game studios have created a monopoly in such a way that a small dedicated studio cannot compete here, it's much easier to dedicate time to a mobile game instead of a hardcore and serious RTS\\n\\nc) there is a very specific type of fan game studios target: the gaming studios are targeting the loud, attention grabbing, multiplayer obsessed gamer because they're thought to be a safe bet: if they buy into it then everyone will that's why you see unfinished games being rushed, RTS by its nature is far far way from these guys' radars because its built on a very long gratification cycle, it'll take time to build up to a climax, you can see the same mechanic on display with movies too. Slow burners are considered an extremely niche pursuit \\n\\nd) gaming culture change: I personally blame the whole gamergate drama for this but in essence gaming has become exclusionary, games don't try to introduce players and that's where the term 'casual gamer' became an insult: everyone starts somewhere, man, welcome new players in. AoE became massive because a demo of it was packaged into the Windows XP, a lot of players in the early 00s got introduced to RTS via that and cheat codes were a way to ease players in. Games don't focus on introducing and easing players in, there are different ways of enjoying games, some people enjoy it for the agency, some for the stories, RTS games made history fun for so many people; I think that the multiplayer focus is something that is hurting gaming, I think gaming could experiment with releasing a singleplayer version and a multiplayer add-on with different pricing especially in RTS titles\\n\\ne) games are designed against longivity: if you look at RTS titles, they are extremely old, you'd be surprised how many people still play the old versions, you can even see that in the close sibling of rts games, the simulators i.e. Sims, these games are a very different beast and the commerce model of gaming studios are now more akin to the fast fashion industry.

            "Ultima Online was singlehandedly the greatest isometric game ever created. I'm not saying there aren't others that were great, but nothing checked as many boxes as UO:T2A-UO:R eras. Vast open world. Skill based combat. Karma systems. Vibrant towns. Wealth of MEANINGFUL professions. Private, but robable (quite difficult) housing that could be customized to your heart's content with an infinite number of combinations using your acquired, or crafted, goods and treasures. Different forms of physical, magical, and musical skills which could be combined in many different builds to make a character effective at PvE, PvP, or a balance of both. A wealth of crafting abilities, to the point where crafters were dedicated characters. RP communities that took great pride in their work. So many dungeons and points of interest... boss instances... mining... fishing... treasure hunting on your boat on the sea... the list goes on and on... sadly the game doesn't hold up today graphically, but it's a nostalgia beyond most others and I don't just mean video games. There's never been another game quite like it.",

When I asked how he always knows where I am he smirked and said it was because I smell like my mother. Recently he walked up to me with a weird smile, I think he was trying to look normal but whenever he gets excited he always twiddles his toes, so as he was talking to me I could hear the sound of his socks crunching in the background. I pretended not to notice it as he showed me some knock-off Mario movie and said we could watch it early. I tried my best to ignore his odor and I really wanted him to leave me alone so I replied \u201cumm, ok\u201d. I think he liked that answer because he giggled and waddled off to the basement.

            "I'm pretty sure it's about the way the story is told in game. When you look at something like ragnarok or the more classic interactive movies like beyond 2 souls what you get in terms of \"gameplay\" tends not to be much or to not be suoer important. The gameplay kinda acts as a filler to progress you from one story scene to the next while the actual story os told almost exclusively through cutscenes rather than the actions you take in gameplay. If you look at something like call of duty that has loads of cutscenes you can see a difference in the way the story progress through a mission. While you're advancing through the mission you're being rold things and finding things while still actively aying so the story unfolds through gameplay and updating objectives as you progress. Something like beyond 2 souls and ragnarok just have gameplay that mostly functions to bridge one story arc to the next",

            "I\u2019m sorry but the gameplay doesn\u2019t act as filler anymore than the original trilogy does and trying to compare it to Beyond 2 souls sound really absurd because as someone who played both of them, there is a clear difference between the two. I could tell that a lot of effort went into combat, you had to get the timing right, you have to be familiar with the enemy attack patterns, use different weapons for different enemy, you go through several different mini bosses as well as main bosses, and that doesn\u2019t cover the puzzles and exploration elements of the game. It really seem like just because God of War Ragnarok also put effort into its story mode is enough for people to label it as a interactive movie",

Like watching doom isn\u2019t the same as playing it, because it\u2019s a different experience, but my example of Detroit become human is around the same experience, because the game is so narrative.",
            "So like the original trilogy where you take on massive hordes of the same enemies? Because that\u2019s what the original trilogy did as well, only different is you spent most of the combat pressing square square triangle. Like I played every god of war games from PS2/P/3/4/5 and I can say with certainty that Ragnarok is as much a game as they were",
            "You completely missed the point of my comment. The interactive movie genre isn't applied based on the type of gameplay. It specifically only applies to the way the story unfolds in game. For ragnarok most of the combat doesn't tell you any story. Like i said look at a call of duty level for example. When you play a mission the objective updates as you progress and the story is told while you're fighting and with the changing objectives. If you only watch cutscenes from COD you only get like 30 or 40% of the actual storylinem if you then compare that ragnarok or beyond 2 souls you can get the full story exclusively through watching the cutscenes, there are extra story bits scattered around specifically in ragnarok more than beyond 2 souls but for the most part the .ain story unfolds through cinematics rather than gameplay. At no point was i trying to inply that the gameplay in the games is similar or anything. The devs themselves classified it as an interactive movie because that's just what the classification means",

            "Games are games. Just bc it\u2019s not you\u2019re type of game doesn\u2019t make something an interactive movie.",
            "Here\u2019s my genuine opinion: although I do believe this claim is mostly due to console wars, there are some people who have a very narrow view of what gaming is. You can literally go hours without a cut scene. They\u2019re only triggered when you hit certain parts in the main narrative,\\n\\nIf this were an interactive movie, it\u2019d be mainly QTE\u2019s. GoWR actually requires you to understand your enemies. When to block and when and how to attack. If not, you\u2019ll be one or two shot.\\n\\nBut anything that has detailed cut scenes where you don\u2019t have to piece together the story, some feel makes it a \u201cinteractive movie.\u201d\\n\\nIf you stick to mainly side quests or finish the story, you hardly encounter any cut scenes. If it\u2019s not simply action or from software form or storytelling, some critics believe it\u2019s an \u201cinteractive movie.\u201d",
            "Problem is, the original three didn't try to pretend they were anything other than what they were- hack and slash action games with the occasional puzzle, and a plot thrown in for the sake of giving you a reason to murder half of Olympus.\\n\\nThe recent GoWs are character-drama stories with some quite good but not groundbreaking combat added in.",
            "No I get your point, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. So because a story isn\u2019t told through its gameplay but through cutscenes, it\u2019s an interactive movie. Most mainstream games tell their story through cutscenes. GTA, RDR, Yakuza, kingdom hearts, Final Fantasy, Resident evil, Devil May Cry, MGS, Silent hill, are all games that I can think off the top of my head that rely mostly on cut scene to tell their story.",
            "Except it\u2019s not even a significant chunk of the game. Like my total game time with Ragnarok was around 50-60 hours (doing all the side quests and getting all\\nThe collectibles) there is only around 7 hours of story related moments in the game. So that isn\u2019t even 1/5 of the game and we aren\u2019t talking about quality by pointing out how long it is but how much gameplay is in it which there is more of it than story in this game",
            "Oh well god forbid they actually put in the effort to tell a compelling story instead of being a \u201cdumb fun killing time\u201d the game, also I would say the gameplay in it is better and tighter than most other hack and slash games as well as Elden Ring (one of my favorite game of all time)",
            "Yea, I've always found video game genres weird though to be fair i can alsp see why it's so hard to classify a game. Taking GTA for example as you said it can easily be an interactive movie because the only instances of minor story elements gettinf to u outside of cutscenes would be over a phone call which is just gonna have you drive to a cutscene. Then again GTA could easily be an rpg, or just a third/first person shooter if we're talking abt GTA V specifically. When you look at the actual game genre it's listed as open world action and adventure. I'm guessing that the devs for god of war probably wanted to stop being classified as a hack and slash game so they changed up the combat with some new really cool mechanics while still staying true to the hack and slashy feel of combat eith hoards 9f enemies but with a sort of relaunch of their game series they probably figured a new genre would be good for sales so decided to put it in as interactive movie. \\n\\nNow that i think of it I'd even guess the same is true for GTA, instead of just tagging themselves as another shooter, especially since there's lots of gameplay you can do that has no shooting whatsoever, they probably just went for hthat open world action adventure tag. And like i also said you could argue that it's an RPG since it essentially lets you live an alternative life in los santos doing things as simple as taxi driving but the issue with having an rpg tag is that people tend to expect certain things from it like a perk tree and a more fleshed out skill tree than what GTA has",
            "My point wasn't \"they should go back to being mindless murder simulator\", my point was that the combat and the story were poorly meshed. It was five minutes of story and then \"Oh no! Random Enemy x5!\" Then proceed along with two minutes of either scenery or walk-and-talk until \"Oh no! Random Enemy x8!\"\\n\\nEverything else is fantastic, but the gameplay and story are mashed together about as well as a 1990s JRPG.",
            "Well way I see it, an interactive movie would be like Until Dawn, Heavy Rain, Or Telltales games like TWD. Games that are like point and click adventure games but have choice driven story telling through cutscenes where you can choose dialogue or action, and the rising action moments are done with QTE.\\n\\nI think a game can rely on cutscenes and still be considered a game as long as it have more gameplay in it than cutscenes. Like I would consider GTA to be a third person shooter open world game because you\u2019re spending most of the time shooting, driving and exploring the world. And I would say God of War is an hack and slasher because the majority of it is hack and slash gameplay.",
            "That definitely feels like it's how it should be but it's not always like that and as I said, I kinda get the feeling ragnarok was tagged interactive movie just to stray away from being labeled as another hack and slash since they're generally less popular games although really idk if it would've made a difference. Ragnarok is just a good game overall and I'm sure they would've done just fine calling it as it is"

The 3060 is ~50-60% of the performance of the 3080, so it should be able to handle it just fine.

Their solutions would be to either cram several times as much hardware into their cards, to bring back Crossfire specifically for RT, or to design their cards with hardware that runs RT workloads significantly more efficiently like Nvidia has done from the start.  They're doing the latter right now with the 7900xt and xtx, so there's the solution.  This can't be retrofitted into consoles, only added into the next generation of consoles when they launch, so current gen consoles are not going to get this tech, simple as that.",

Tales of Arise was the same way, you were thrown into some mid game area with some random things to complete and didn't make much sense.

            "I'm legitimately curious to what you're talking about. He didn't feel cheaty to me. I sucked at parrying him because his attacks always take longer than I expect. And his attacks tend to track a lot. But I'm not sure what roll catching you're talking about.\\n\\nIn fact he telegraphs so much that it really makes him a ton easier if you don't get greedy. Every time he does that huge jump at you, you just roll towards him as he gets close. He'll wiff and you'll be right behind him to punish. In fact rolling through him is generally the thing to do. It's the staff move where he pulls it back and charges it that you have to watch out for, just because it has insane tracking as I recall.",
            "Godrick isn't hard, but I'd say he's harder than Margit, at least for the builds I go with. It's mostly just because Godrick just throws out a ton of crazy AoE's that are much more of a pain in the ass to avoid. In fact you normally have to position yourself in a place to avoid it right at the start of the animation, or you just won't be able to get out of it. As I recall he's one of the bosses that if you want to avoid his damage you need to stick really close to him. But he also has that break dance move that is a pain if you're really close.\\n\\nMargit is much easier to beat if you've got a good 100% physical shield with high stability. You can just tank him without dodging, he'll chip away at your health pretty slowly via magic damage. You might need to dodge his big jump AoE but that's really easy to dodge. Most of his attacks are so slow that if he breaks your block you'll still recover in time the block the next.\\n\\nIf you have a hard time with him, I recommend getting the brass shield from the guards (it's kind of rare but they're super easy to kill). It's 100% physical with good stability and relatively low stat requirements. Make sure you get the summoning bell and the jelly fish summons.\\n\\nWalk into the boss fight and summon the jelly fish. Then immediately rush him with your shield up. What you want to do is keep him between you and the jelly fish. The jelly fish doesn't do a lot of damage, but after a few hits it'll poison him, as I recall it only takes two poisonings to kill him. Just keep him on you and keep blocking. He'll do very little damage but you might need to estus flask a couple times, but you don't really have to worry about attacking. He'll occasionally ignore you and start walking toward the jelly fish. Just hit him a few times and he'll start focusing on you again.\\n\\nIt for the most part makes him a really easy fight. And the brass shield is a pretty good shield if you like medium shields that can parry.",

            "If you're going to do the strategy I laid out I'd recommend not taking the summons. You'll have to spend more time attacking to try and keep aggro off the summons, and if you're a beginner this means you're more likely to get hit.\\n\\nIf you don't keep aggro the summons will die and you'll be fighting a Margit with more HP, and poison takes forever to kill him.",
            "I legit only passed cuz i remembered \"Hey! his jump is parriable\"",
            "Yup! Use the whip against beasts and you'll be fine, I love the cane and I also did my first run with it, but the early game can be a little rough - you'll feel it getting easier and easier the more you play, skill stat based weapons are amazing with parry attacks too, so get used to the timing as soon as possible and you will destroy any duel in the lategame",

My first game of that type, bought months after release and I sunk 200 hours into it, easily became one of my fav games of all time. \\n\\nAnd I hate every fan baby who goes after other games just because it\u2019s the direct competition. I wanted elden ring to win even if GoW is one of my fav franchises of all time( gow 3 is the best)",

            "my personal GOTY pick was god of war, went in expecting elden ring to net the award. it did, I felt happy for the devs, finished watching, and went to bed. AMA",
            "I personally like God of War better, but this is just childish. Congrats to the Elden Ring team.",
            "Didnt ER fanboys start this trend ? lol",
            "I\u2019m still upset that Elden Ring won, I want to give the game a try but I\u2019m shit at video games specially the dark souls games! There\u2019s no easy mode it\u2019s hardcore to play. That\u2019s why GOWR was amazing to play, in easy mode!",

Lots of people like it and my opinion doesn't detract from that. I never really liked the Borderlands games. Doesnt stop them bring great games as its just my personal preference and opinion.\\n\\nThese people are giving GoW fans a bad name.\\n\\n\"We must be better\" - Kratos, GoW 2",
            "I see 1 maybe 2 comments saying that gow is better.",

            "I don't know why I'd still rather play GOW on play station anyway",
            "To be fair the best Souls game is and always was DS2 Scholar of the First Sin. It has the best PvP and gameplay and best characters/voice acting. Elden Ring only has better graphics.",

            "Fuck me. I downloaded the game (ER) on Friday, and played until a bit after the first boss. Not because I raged. Because I had to sleep since it was 12 AM. It is really one of the best games I ever played. I didn\u2019t play GoW Ragnarok, since I don\u2019t have a PS. I believe it is a great game, but man. You don\u2019t have to be such sore losers.",
            "People shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have a voice",
            "Which is why you should never take user scores seriously, either everything is a 10 or a 0 and at least with critics, you can at least assumed they played the game",
            "Imagine being this asshurt over an award\\n\\nYou wanna know what I did when God of War won GOTY over Red Dead Redemption 2 back in 2018?,  I moved on and felt happy for Santa Monica, while it wasn\u2019t my personal pick for 2018\u2019s Game of the Year, I still felt happy for the team, and Sony for winning GOTY, and I still moved on with my life and not gave a shit\\n\\nThe same for Elden Ring, while it\u2019s not my personal Game of the Year, I can still congratulate FromSoft for all the hard work and dedication they put in making such a quality title and move on with my life\\n\\nCause that what mature, sound-minded adults do, not this petty tantrum throwing bullshit, these guys need to find more important shit to get pissed off over in life than their game not winning GOTY, my god",
            "The Elden Ring fans did the same thing a few days before the awards.  It's just nerds being nerds.  Posts like this only give them attention.  Better to just ignore it, because it's meaningless anyway.",
            "Pretty sad from both sides, but it's more sad from Playstation fans because both games are playable on Playstation. I mean I can understand an Xbox fan that hasn't had a good exclusive game in forever to be mad, but a Playstation fan that gets 2-3 good exclusives + all the multiplatforms, including Elden Ring, every year? Their lifes have to be very empty to care about that.",
            "This is so depressing.  Both of them were amazing games and either of them would have deserved it.  I felt the same way when God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2 were nominated.  I was hoping for Red Dead back then,  but I didn't go and leave negative reviews for another equally great game.  Don't understand these people at all,  it's fine having a preference but not like this.",
            "There\u2019s a reason why I trust critics FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR more than any form of user scores.",
            "Pretty sure both games got review bombed. What's the site from your pic?",
            "Too late bois..",
            "Another example of **why user reviews are useless**",
            "They aren't god of war fans they're just dumb people not even gamer in my opinion",

            "lets not forget fromsoft fans review bombed ragnarok days before the game awards",
            "Whenever someone tells me I don't have a life I'll just show them this, there are some truly miserable ppl out there.",
            "God of War already had its moment in 2018 when RDR2 swept, but didn\u2019t win GOTY grow thicker skin. Awards and ratings are borderline useless; form your own opinions.",
            "Reasons why I truly don\u2019t believe The Last Jedi\u2019s audience score on RT",
            "Lol triggered rag fans in shambles.",
            "I like the person who said elden ring has ps4 graphics.. \\n\\n\\nGod of war ragnarok is a ps4 game",

            "I wonder if the first comment is from under the mayo lol",
            "The sad thing is, I'm sure the developers at Santa Monica Studios would be mortified their \"fans\" did this. They'd be furious at them.",
            "Oh ffs - Soulsborne games are deeply PS games, so dumb being this petty",
            "There's too much game in my game. I demand less content. There should only be 1 hour of gameplay for my 100 bucks",
            "Elden Ring and any souls game looks about as fun as sliding your balls on a cheese grater while edward scissor hands pushes them against it from the inside of your anus. \\n\\nBut you know, whatever youre into",
            "These people dont know that a game doesnt need \" graphics \" to be good . A good game is made out of good story telling , unique characters and challenging enemies . thats what a true good game is . God of war is a great game but i feel like elden ring deserved it more . Also elden ring came out wayyyy before god of war .",
            "But I do not understand why some people recommend you to choose God Of War (instead of Elden Ring) on the Xbox Elden Ring metacritic review page. \\n\\nAlso I played ragnarok and really enjoyed it, but Elden Ring is most definately the superior game.",
            "I don't know why people can't just like both. I was rooting for both of them no matter what the result was gonna be. I mean, at least it was a solid year for good games overall.",
            "And people said Elden Ring fans were toxic...",
            "God of war is like call of duty in way. New story better graphics. Pretty much same gameplay. Elden ring is a winner",
            "Haters gonna hate. Did it deserve GotY over God of War? In my honest opinion, no. It's like a 9.5 to GoW's 10 but I'm not surprised it won. It's a fantastic game.",
            "Lol. That's exactly how I always imagined GoW fans.\\nBtw their game is overrated.",
            "I understand that elden ring won. Cause it was just too big of a succes hit when it launched. However, the only thing that made it stick out was just because it was the first openworld soulsgame. And that the dude from gamr of thrones wrote the story. If it wasn't for that it wouldn't have been such a massive succes. But imo the best soulsgame is still bloddborne, and most fun combat is sekiro. Elden ring is like on the 3rd place for me. And my personal goty is gow, but i find story and music extremely important in games so i knew from the start i was gonna like it more xD",
            "Why would GoW win GOTY when more than half of all players can't play it? Less people can play it, so less people can like it.\\n\\nIt's just a numbers thing based on how game of the year is chosen, which is a blend of jury and public voting.\\n\\nTIL: don't point out the shortcomings of exclusivity when Sony people are in the room. ExcLusiVeS gOod, mA PlaYsTation. So toxic, you ruin this sub smh.",
            "I love it when people say stuff like \u00ab\u00a0PS4 graphics\u00a0\u00bb. Like God of War, then?",
            "Why do people ACTIVELY choose to be wrong?",
            "Is this more of a \u201cMost Advanced Graphics\u201d award? How were either contenders better than Bayonetta 3, Kirby, Triangle Strategy, Xenoblade 3\u2026 it\u2019s all arbitrary.",
            "Ah, the good old PS exclusive fanboys.",
            "Ofc they are, Sony fanboys only care about exclusives and awards to feel superior.",
            "But seriously, whats with the outdated graphics?",
            "Lmao no its genshins fanbase mad they didnt get an award for best music they even made a whole post about it on their sub lmao.",
            "Yeah dude, they can't enjoy god of war any more. They can't lose gamer points by playing a game that ISNT game of the year.",
            "I genuinely dom't understand why a linear game with in reality, no innovation from the previous game, can be seen as such a great game. I understand the story, graphics and music are great but like, it is still just a linear story you will most likely only play once. Theres no real replayability to it.",
            "They didn't even deserve the award the first time. It should have been RDR2. Elden Ring is out of the question.",
            "Typical Snoy behavior",
            "I have a very simple solution for these Gentlemen struggling with elden ring. Git gud noobs",
            "I don't like any of these 2 games . Specially elden crap.",
            "those morons think their cookie cutter children's game is better Lol\\n\\nGod of war barely deserves game of the month.",
            "Both games story was crap",
            "Somehow i can't see this happening if gow won and ER lost. Sony stans are a special bunch",
            "Use me as a downvote button",
            "Are these salty Elden Ring fans because GoWR won so many awards or salty GoWR fans displaying their frustration at Santa Monica for not making a better game? \\n\\nThese are some pathetic losers either way but feels unclear to me",
            "If GoW wanted GOTY then they should have ported it to PC at least.   Don't expect GOTY if you shut out 75% of gamers (Xbone + PC + Nintendo)",
            "  GoW fans = PS fan bois therefore toxic",
            "Ahh Sony Ponies",
            "Well of course. They and their Playstation inferiority complex just got bitchslapped. \\n\\nWait until PC/Xbox exclusive Starfield wins it next year.",
            "I am completely dumbfounded by Elden Ring winning game of the year. I am a seasoned gamer but can't imagine anyone outside of masochistic souls bros enjoying it. I had no idea what to do. Didn't have any idea of what a good build was. Felt like it was a 10 year old game once it started. I finally got above ground and I was beyond underwhelmed by the graphics and the staleness and lifelessness of the world. Got fucking clobbered by the first enemy I encountered. Had to read about try again just move on. There is no introduction, no progression learning about the mechanics.\\n\\nIt really is a fucking cunt sandwich of a game. I only went back a few times because of the hype. People promising me it is redefining the open world genre. I hate you. I hate every one of you cunts who made me spend time it that shithole. I love the Ubishit open world games. I love Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, Immortals Fenyx Rising. My game of the year is Horizon Forbidden West. You cant even put that shit up against HFW.\\n\\nTelling me to git gub bro is a fucking insult to good games with good level progression. Fuck this cunt of a game and any cunt telling me this is redefining open world games.",

Apples to oranges comparison between them both and really it comes down to what people prefer. Both look great, both have interesting storytelling, combat is a blast and each manage to create interesting difficulty with it. Berserkers on GoW are excellent advanced challenge fights for those seeking them and of course ER is pretty much a nonstop trip through masochism. Both fights are compelling  and each have cinematic value unlike many games that have come out this year. GoW has a basic RPG element through their use of armor and weapon specific skill trees to keep most average players very happy and then if you\u2019re seeking the depth and articulate nature derived from ER\u2019s RPG elements you can find yourself at home with a huge variety of weapons, armor and stats at your disposal. \\n\\nThe idea that \u201cbigger\u201d means more effort went into the game is ridiculous as a point I\u2019m seeing people make. It\u2019s just comparing an open-world game to a more linear story game. What one game has for a pro the other tends to have a counterpart con. It\u2019s literally a coin toss of whether a game won that award and it ended up just simply enough that someone had to win and one had a larger fan base. GoW is a brand new game practically and put up one hell of a showing. ER is just as incredible for keeping their fanbase entertained for a majority of time up until this point considering it was nearly a year ago it released. \\n\\nWell done to both games.

I'm not saying there isn't overlap, there is. But hardcore fans of GOW don't play or think about games the same way as hardcore fans of elden ring. Likewise, kids that mainly played madden think and behave differently from the kids that gravitated towards RPGs. Not saying anyone is right or wrong in how they approach and consume media, but different people can approach the same media in vastly different ways. As someone who, if I do enjoy a game I will play it for at least 300 hours and probably embarassingly more(im a sucker for resource and stat management); I personally know that the way my brain gets endorphins from that kind of long-game activity means that I just can't bring myself to focus or care about short term, intangible things like \"my favorite game of the year\" winning a game of the year title, or my schools' football team winning state, or my country getting gold medals. I have no personal investment in that contest, it's not like the games I like where I'm rooting for the characters because I managed their team and stats, or it's my character and those are MY stats. I get that people enjoy those short term, lower commitment dramas like your sports rivalries, your battle royales and your cinematic games, but I'm just not wired to enjoy it. Id literally rather watch someone with a personality type that lets them fully enjoy GOW do a let's play, and just people watch how they enjoy the game rather than play it myself.",

You might hate Gravemind more than this, but at least that level has skips, LNoS has none. \\n\\nThe elites in Reach are the toughest in any hall and this mission is full of the highest ranking elites who all get concussion rifles on legendary, a splash damage weapon that they juggle you with. On top of that, in the space sections, the banshees are easy, but the Seraphs? Hell no. \\n\\nThe seraphs take time to kill, and while you\u2019re lining up a shot, another will come behind you and try to kill you. And probably succeed. It\u2019s so difficult to make it past the seraph section, that the most efficient speedrun strategy, is let the teammates kill them while you hide. \\n\\nThen we have the length of this mission, the first part goes pretty fast, then we have the space section that takes up a majority of the time, then the ship infiltration, where all the goddamn elites are, you also got grunts with fuel rod cannons. Then a final firefight section that can be so RNG, that the developers literally put in an indestructible secret vehicle in this section. \\n\\nAnd to top it all off, we have this little tidbit. On Halo Reach, this mission is MUCH easier. Why? Well, MCC runs at a frame rate that Reach never was supposed to run at. And those Seraphs? Their fire rate is tied to the frame rate. Because of the higher frame rate, they get increased fire speed, meaning they can kill your ass in less than a literal second, that\u2019s right, the remastered version of Reach on MCC is harder than the base game!",

HOW? And putting a timer on a turn based rpg is wack in general in the first place. Along with the constant enemy respawn if you don\u2019t kill all the minions first before dealing with Okumura so you could be stuck there. Funny thing is too\u2026merciless (the hardest difficulty) makes the fight that much easier cause you and the enemy does 3 times more damage if hit by weakness/technical hits. Like yea it\u2019s pretty easy if you\u2019re prepared but it\u2019s legit a timer, possibility of constant minion respawn\u2026and the in-game dialogue during the boss fight for the plot DOES NOT STOP THE TIMER.",

Their inability to adapt to failure. The complete and utter desire: Fuck everyone else, carry me.\\n\\nAnd the dungeon Grim Batol taught me this hate. The third boss in the dungeon has pretty much just one single mechanic. He spawns in a monster. THe monster designates a target and creates a neon orange laser between the monster and their target. Then the monster runs straight at that guy at player runspeed. When it comes in contact with that player they die. No ifs ands or buts about it. No stopping it. *They just die*. Health 5 million? Damage 40 million. End of story.\\n\\nI was a tank. My friend a healer. At the time tanks werent allowed to have much damage nor were healers. That was the design. I went through over 15 players before I got a single melee DPS that would help try and kill these monsters. His DPS enabled us to make progress onthe boss passed the first 4 summons. But he was melee dps. When the monster picks him he cant help.\\n\\nIn the end, if you evade the monster long enough, it automatically kills you anyway. The monster must be killed in its timeframe. So he would die. We would wipe because the other two DPS would not run away from the monster and just die. They would leave. I would get new dps. And we'd have another round of 'Do these people have any grey matter in their skulls or are they just NPCs playing pretend?'\\n\\nI did not believe that people would ever be like this. My stubbornness drug my friend through that fucking dungeon until we got a ranged damage dealer. A single person. That had the presence of mind to assist in dealing with that mechanic. Which was obtained after about 3 hours of tackling that dungeon. We cleared that boss in one attempt. And then also one shotted the next boss.\\n\\nYes. I tried to explain these bossfights to everyone we had. Except in the case of the two dudes who helped do the mechanic, not one single player responded to chat prior tot he boss. And only a handful did after wiping on said boss. And they only did it to accuse the healer of being a shit healer and not keeping them alive. I stopped making attempts to explain the boss after the first hour. I'd ask in chat if everyone knew the boss or if they need an explanation I would give it. No one would answer. Wed pull the boss. Wipe. Rez. Pull the boss. Wipe. Rez. And theyd leave.\\n\\nFucking three hours of that horse shit.",

Takes place in a silver mine where everything at ground level is covered in poisonous mist and you're limited on the amount of antidotes you can carry.

The boss of the level, however, is a giant poison and paralysis spewing centipede with a boring moveset that has high damage and is just a pile of HP.\\n\\n*The Demon King Revealed* from Nioh 1. Takes place on a floating castle with a bunch of narrow pathways once more above instant death. At one point, to progress, it requires a butt puckering drop onto a tiny ledge that wraps around a cliff, where you're ambused by a Tengu, which is probably the single most hated elite enemies in the game; it easily inflicts you with the Blustered debuff that lowers your attack by 20%, has a lot of fast, hard-hitting moves, and several where it hovers out of reach. Luckily, though, you have two AI companions who are actually pretty competent (most of the time). About halfway through, though, you're separated from them and the level turns into a rather boring boss rush with **seven** different bosses, four of whom you've already fought over the course of the game. The final boss, Yamata-no-Orochi, is also a pain in the ass to fight because it's a giant serpent who only comes close enough for you to hit about a third of the time and has 8 heads that you have to kill over the course of three phases.",

You'll have to kill a perfumer toget to him. He will give you half of the secret haligtree medallion and tell you to find latenna. If you return to the roundtable hold, ensha will attack you until you kill him. Once you do, speaking to Gideon will reveal dialogue in which he advises you to find the albinauric woman (latenna) in a cave west of the laskyar ruins in the southern liurnia lake. She is being hunted by a bloodhound knight boss. When you find her after you've met albus, she'll offer to tell you where the other half of the medallion is. It's in the mountaintops of the giants, at castle sol in the northernmost point of the map. Defeat the knight commander there and the the other half of the medallion is at the top of a lift behind the boss room. Once you've got it, go back to the grand lift of rold. When the prompt appears to take you to back down/up the lift, you'll have an option to use your d-pad to switch to the secret medallion, which takes you to a dungeon that leads into an area called the consecrated snowfield.

            "I played WoW starting in the original beta up until shadowlands. I'll still occasionally play WoW classic or a private server running anything up to Wrath, but won't touch the modern retail version. I also played ESO long enough to finish the base game and have never bothered with it since, and that took years of picking away at it because deep down I knew I just wanted elder scrolls 6. And going back to Star Wars Galaxies I played an architect build and placed mining machines to collect materials so that I could build bigger machines and buildings to sell, never bothered even carrying a weapon and would die to wonp rats because I had fun just living as a fish dude in that galaxy far far away.\\n\\nMy point being that we will all find a style we find fun and it doesn't matter what is popular, mainstream or niche because all that matters is personal taste. Try a few out and pick the one you feel drawn to. And if you lose interest after a month try another. And another, and so on until you either find \"the one\" or decide MMOs aren't for you which is the case for many people and also totally fine.",

Some of the MMOs are subscription based and it would suck to pay for it and find out you don't like the genre at all. Each MMO has its own way of trying to make money, from subscriptions to pay-to-win to showing off your cool skins or paid expansions. Good luck and if you want me to RAVE for far too long about the MMO I play, just ask.\\n\\nAs for the difference between old and modern, I feel like the old MMOs were a little more hardcore in terms of grinding. More modern games have found ways to discourage marathon sessions to sprint up in power with time gates (which also keeps you coming back daily to reach your goals). I feel like modern MMOs tend to do sharing better. I can remember back in the day being furious when another player game and stole a mob I was waiting to respawn."

Dumb...just dumb. \\nNo, the cause and effect of exclusives, as well as those of monopolies, are plain and simple; **greed**. **Greed** to the extent where many of the most basic but at the same time most sacred laws of our race like ethics/empathy/pack first mentality/long term well-being and societal progress are simply tossed out the window in favour of the ego.\\n\\nIf Microsoft would use the same practices as the shit Sony has pulled over the years, and still do, we would have had an absolute crap fest of a market and it would not benefit anyone in the slightest. \\nIt would be poor business for MS. \\n\\nThey don't do that however, they've realised that maybe, just maaybee, doing the opposite of being stingy and squeeze customers for everything their worth short term it can be equally and, **surprise**, actually be even more profitable short AND long term. \\nThey are making deals of **inclusiveness** which they're not forced to make and publically state repeatedly that they want games to be gamed by as many as possible. \\n\\nThe reason Sony is acting like the jealous 5 year old bully in the sandbox is because **they** have shown  what dubious material their flimsy character is made of and doubled down on earnings through **exclusiveness**. \\nThey are the only ones that actually want this *console bumper cars* to break out in out **console mad max**.\\n\\nIf you're still not getting it and feel just as daft as this \"reporter\"...\\nPonder the answer to the average gaming hipster's favourite question:\\n\\n\"What console platform and franchise has what most people would consider the best and the most exclusive titles in its portfolio...?\" \\n\\n:)",
            "Preventing monopolies or cartelisation os such unfair practices is necessary. They have the right to do that, not limited to gaming. It's function is somewhat similar in this respect to SEBI and CCI in my country.",
            "tl;dr: \"taking steps to reduce competition is no problem, because there is currently competition\"\\nYes, and we'd prefer to keep it that way....",
            "Maybe the ftc should stop monopolies on things that matter, like electricity or internet...",
            "The thing that pisses me off \u2014 and I will always come back to this \u2014 is that this is not at all about consumers. \\n\\nIt\u2019s a multinational billionaire tech company \u2014 with a lockdown on their own exclusives \u2014 whining to the FTC that another multinational billionaire company may want limited exclusivity to protect their investment. \\n\\nAs though Microsoft owes it to Sony to sell COD access to a competitor platform, but is meant to stay silent and remain shut out from TLOU, Spider titles, GOW, Ghost\u2026, etc. \\n\\nAnd then, on top of it, *everyone* ignores the actual monopolistic deathgrip here\u2026from Nintendo\u2019s dominance of the handheld market. \\n\\nThe thumb is being placed on the scale to skew the actual competition part, the definition of crony capitalism, and the actual monopoly is being ignored.",
            "For the people who can't be bothered to read the article before commenting:\\n\\n> The FTC argues that through this $69 billion deal, Microsoft will be able to suppress competition from rival consoles by making Activision Blizzard games exclusive to its platforms. [...] \\n\\n> It's such a profound misunderstanding of the gaming industry. Platform exclusives happen because the industry is so competitive that it is one of many avenues for a company to have an advantage. [...]\\n\\n> Video game consumers were not being deprived of choices. If anything, because of the pricing involved, consumers had so many choices that most avid gamers couldn't actually afford to purchase all the available choices. The purpose of these exclusives is to try to steer players to certain platforms with promises of access to the types of games they'd enjoy.\\n\\n>All of this is weirdly removed from the current state of Activision Blizzard, which has been rocked with management scandals and transitions over widespread sexual harassment claims and abuse of employees. The value of Activision Blizzard shares dropped 37 percent in 2021. The players themselves have been complaining about the degrading of Activision's game quality over the past few years. World of Warcraft subscription numbers have been declining since 2016, and the company stopped publicly reporting them in 2015. The last expansion, Shadowlands, was given fairly unfavorable reviews by players. A newly released expansion, Dragonflight, is getting some better early scores, but it'll be time to see how the experience shakes out. Similarly, Overwatch 2, the sequel to the once-well-liked team shooter game, is getting absolutely trashed by players for not really improving or adding that much to the original. And none of that comes even close to the player response to Diablo Immortal, a mobile game that will probably be remembered more for its predatory real-money microtransactions than anything involving actual gameplay.\\n\\n> All of this is to say that the average Activision Blizzard game consumer probably doesn't see himself or herself being well-served by the company's status quo. Therefore, if the purpose of these actions from the FTC is to allegedly protect the consumer from big, bad corporate behavior, it's rather bizarre to see how little the actual experiences of consumers are mentioned in the FTC's 23-page complaint.",
            "That is their business.",
            "> Maybe the ftc should stop monopolies\\n\\nFTFY",
            "\"this doesn't matter\" is kind of a weird stance to take in a sub dedicated to the industry, tbh.",
            "The whole point is that Microsoft is not just a gaming company. And it's using its dominant position in other sectors - that \"matter\" - to spread its reach to gaming and other sectors. \\n\\nAnd on the other hand, utilities are already regulated more heavily.",
            "Dominating a particular market doesn't mean its a monopoly",
            "It\u2019s funny how they\u2019re not kosher with one corpo buying another outright to own exclusivity but if another corpo spends what 200mil to keep stuff off another system they don\u2019t actually own, that\u2019s a-okay."

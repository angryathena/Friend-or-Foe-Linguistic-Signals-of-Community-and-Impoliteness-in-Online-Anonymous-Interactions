They \u2019re among my favorite things to draw.  \ud83e \udd70 ",

The English video correctly called them something other than a name that isn't the type of automaton that they obviously are. Good on the translators for not calling it a golem then and realizing how offensive it would be, or perhaps not realizing, and just deciding not to. ",

            "I'm really glad I saw this post, I had no idea golems were from Jewish folklore! I'm definitely gonna look more into the history of it, and of course be more conscious about how use it. Neat!",
            "@princessxombie  \ud83d \udc97 awww thank you!! i for love it a lot. hopefully it's something I can loophole like i did with the stupid clock shrine in botw. everyone hates the motion ones, but that shrine was horrible",

            "@ziskeyt absolutely. Speedrunners and people who just have infinity patience are so fun to watch",
            "@excelsian I would absolutely watch that video, i love seeing people play who are better at games than i am!",
            "@ziskeyt As other Tumblrinas/Online people have said. GIve some japanese player 6h and they will construct a perfectly working Gundam which kills the endboss in one strike.",
            "@excelsian yeah i still wouldn't really like that myself, but it would be more of the spirit of what golems are, at least. but i mean, in this case nintendo isn't the one insisting that there's golems in the game so they don't even need to change anything in this regard.   though it WOULD be cool to fuse a construct to fight for you. or you can use to protect yourself like a gundam haha",
            "@excelsian Tough im not Jewish. So that whole  maybe if-  isnt really up to me to decide xD",
            "Maybe if TOTK showed a 'crafted' talus that you can use to protect urself. But the Constructs aren't really golem-esque",
            "They aren't even made of clay!",
            "entirely unsurprised and fed up with every person like this. they straight up call them constructs in the video but gosh that's just hard to wrap a head around i suppose",

        "thread": " <h1>My Thoughts on Hogwarts Legacy</h1> This is something that has been on my mind recently as more discourse about the topic is coming to the forefrunt of the internet. Hogwarts Legacy and, honestly, the Harry Potter franchise as a whole.  As I see things, there are 5 groups of people when it comes to  \u201cTHAT wizard game. \u201d <ol><li> \u201cHey, I don \u2019t want to play it because of my own personal reasons. But if you want to play it, I hope you have fun. \u201d</li><li> \u201cHey, I do want to play this game because of my own, personal reasons, but I understand that you \u2019re not interested. That \u2019s cool. \u201d</li><li> \u201cThis game gives money to a transphobe?! Awesome! I just bought two copies. \u201d</li><li> \u201cYou want to play this game for your own reasons? You \u2019re a transphobe piece of shit. I won \u2019t stop until you know you \u2019re a piece of shit. \u201d</li><li> \u201cHarry Potter? Hogwarts Legacy? I haven \u2019t played video games since I lost 2 weeks of my life to Banjo Kazooie in 1998. \u201d</li></ol> If you fall into either category 1, 2, or 5, then right on. You \u2019re doing the right thing. Keep it up.  However, if you fall into either category 3 or 4, you are a fucking problem and you need to cut the shit and grow up.  Personally, I fall into category 1. I feel I have made my views on the game and franchise fairly clear. But also, I have a good friend who learned to read because of Harry Potter. I grew up with the franchise and it was a huge part of my childhood, and recognizing that I no longer want to engage in the franchise felt like a huge loss to me, and took some time to reconcile with myself. But, again, I have made that decision based on the larger franchise and not simply this one game. And, also again, these are my OWN PERSONAL REASONS. If you \u2019re interested, I will gladly share my thoughts in a civil manner, and only ask that you understand my thinking, not that you agree with me, or try to convince me to change my mind.  Now, to address category 3. Deep breath, here.  If you are doing anything at all because you know it will make the lives of people worse, then fuck you right to hell. Yes, this group of people also generally goes hand in hand with a specific red hat and an orange demagogue. If you find yourself in this category, get help. Go to therapy and ask about this concept called  \u201cempathy. \u201d  Category 4.  I will repeat: if you are doing anything at all because you know it will make the lives of people worse, then fuck you right to hell. Setting up websites to track Twitch streamers to see who is playing Hogwarts Legacy? Going to channels and harrassing the streamers for wanting to play the game? I would argue that people in this category or worse than those in category 3 because while those in 3 as assholes, they are blowing money on something they don \u2019t actually care about to try triggering someone while people in this group are going out and actively attacking people for engaging something that they want to experience for, and repeat after me, THEIR OWN PERSONAL REASONS. I saw in one chat that someone mentioned they wished executions were legal because people were doing something they didn \u2019t like. Sounds an awful lot like some people who built some gallows outside of a notable large building in the US back in the beginning of January 2021, doesn \u2019t it?  Here \u2019s where things really boil down on Hogwarts Legacy. The game is made. It \u2019s done. Rowling has been paid or will be getting paid. You attacking people for enjoying the game isn \u2019t going to stop that. But there \u2019s a lot more people than just her in the mix, here. Think about all the hundreds of people who have spent YEARS working on making this game, and trying to make it the best game possible. They have also been paid and are continuing to get paid. Controversy has surrounded Hogwarts Legacy pretty much since it was announced. And it wasn \u2019t cancelled.  Here \u2019s where I see things going with the game: it is the outrage of the day. Somewhat surprisingly, the outrage of Hogwarts Legacy \u2019s release is overshadowing the much more recent information about Justin Roiland. People will continue to be upset by this game for a while, and eventually that will fade, as all outrage does.  But you know what won \u2019t pass? The hurt caused by people to other people over this game. Your friend, who you disagree with about the game, sitting in their home, playing the game, is not going to hurt you. Streamer playing the game and you don \u2019t want to watch it? THEN FUCKING DON \u2019T. Full stop. For fuck \u2019s sake, people were buying subs to a twitch stream just so they could continue harrassing the streamers after they made the chat sub-only. Fuck you. Grow up. And like I told the people in group 3, get therapy.  Actually, everyone should go to therapy, but that isn \u2019t the point of this.  Here \u2019s what my point of view boils down to: let people enjoy what they enjoy and stop shitting on things just because people enjoy them. Yes, the situation here is more complex and nuanced than that, but every situation is. And if any part of this rambling has made you angry or upset for any reason, I \u2019d like you to think about why that is. I am not advocating for people to play the game or not play the game. Honestly, I just couldn \u2019t give a fuck what you want to play in the privacy of your own home. I just want people to be better. Treat people better. Be better people. Recognize that everyone on this planet is, at the very least, deserving of being treated like a person and deserving of love. And if you can \u2019t understand that fact, did you really understand Harry Potter at all?  ",

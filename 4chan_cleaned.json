Like seriously.If your character is melee you really want stuff that gives you: +Hit (as in chance to hit), +Crit, and +Attacks. Look for that stuff. Weapon specialization, two weapon fighting, teamwork feats like outflank and seize the moment, improved critical feats. I know that sounds like a word salad but seriously just remember that: HIT. CRIT. ATTACKS. Damage and Defenses are good too, by the way, and if there are not good feats available to you in terms of offense, getting a nice defensive feat is great too, and some of the damage feats like power attack are good when you can overcome their negatives. As long as you remember HIT, CRIT ATTACKS.For spell casters you wanna look at what they&re already good at and just pick everything that powers up what they&re good at. For example, Nenio is a wizard you get. She specializes in illusion magic. If you search &Illusion& you will find feats like specializations and such to power them up. Also spell penetration. You can also take meta magic feats. The two best ones are the Selective (makes it only hit bad guys) and Heighten (lets you basically make a spell higher level so it it is stronger). Get those and just pick shit related to what they do. It looks overwhelming, but just think about what actually makes your spells stronger.

I also agree with the over leveling thing, that&s rare in the game, it&s mainly for things like mana management, or in rare instances, for attack speed timing in rarer instances working with more modern CoC builds (Cospri&s etc). Some builds WANT high cost mana spells, some don&t and depend on very small mana costs and mana leech to push as much power out of the build as possible, but difficulty increases over the time without substantial player buffs (big part of what everyone in the thread is complaining about, their refusal to buff player power/fun) have made that less of a minmax thing and more of a requirement.

GGG said fuck that.One of GGG&s favorite items has been the timeless jewels from Legions. They are given random numbers with stats that can only be seen if they are slotted in your tree. Some are BiS or can make crazy builds due to their power, but the number system made it incredibly hard to trade them if they were extremely good due to a lack of information. GGG loved this.Autists working on POB reverse engineered the algorithm for the timeless jewels. Now you can put whatever number into POB and it will automatically show what it does. Throw some divines at them and you can fish for GG timeless jewels. GGG was infuriated by the thought that their perfect system was broken by players. Instead of doing something reasonable (make jewels corrupted, change how they roll... anything...), GGG unleashes what I think is their biggest shitflinging hissyfit in POE history.

Being hyper-rationalists, the Dunyain see that they have no reason NOT to side with the Consult (as they&re all damned to Hell anyway.)Kellhus, expecting this confrontation, has ensured he&s possessed by a demon so he can nuke them. Unfortunately, they outplay him: Kellhus& crazy son (who is like, twelve) distracts him at a crucial moment and Kellhus is instantly turned to salt, killing him. Kellhus& son is shoved into a sacrophagus and possessed by the No-God, an AI that is both a powerful weapon and has the metaphysical ability to ensure that no living children are born.Outside, Kellhus& army starts celebrating just in time to take the No-God&s manifestation (a black whirlwind) right in the fucking face.Then millions of Orcs come pouring out of Mordor, to rape and kill everyone.

The Rando army kidnapped Buddy because she was the last female in the world and they wanted to keep her protected from rapists until she was ready to have children but Brad wanted to get her back because she was his adopted daughter and his desire to keep her safe and happy stemmed from his failure to protect his little sister, Lisa, from her father who would abuse, neglect, and isolate her, and even rape her. Each side of this conflict was sympathetic and had understandable motives and it was ambiguous which one wad truly right in the end, as opposed to Last of Us, where there&s a clear good guy and bad guy when that wasn&t the intention in the first place.I mean, the TV series made a straight adaptation of the video game but it&s a TV show so it doesn&t have to end like a video game setpiece.
